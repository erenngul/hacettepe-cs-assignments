This is a two-phase binary search tree (TPBST) structure,
in which each node of main Binary Search Tree (BST) keeps a pointer to its own uniquely associated
secondary BST. This specialized two-phase binary search tree structure is used as the inmemory database of a webstore that has different categories and items belongs to categories. Secondary BST is implemented as both AVL tree and left leaning red black tree.
