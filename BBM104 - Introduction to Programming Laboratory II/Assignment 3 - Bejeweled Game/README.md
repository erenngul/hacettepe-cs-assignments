This is a simplified version of the game "Bejeweled" using Java. In this assignment, the game consists of a grid (of any size, e.g. 10x10) of "jewels". Some example jewels are Diamond (D), Square (S), Triangle (T) and Wildcard (W). The goal is to find three jewels that are match in a row, column or diagonal by selecting the right coordinate. When this occurs, the three jewels are deleted, and other jewels fall from the top to fill in gaps.
